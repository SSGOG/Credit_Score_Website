            <h1>Credit Information</h1>

            <h2>Credit Scores</h2>
            <p>There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good</li>
                <li>Standard</li>
                <li>Poor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution.</p>

            <h2>Annual Income</h2>
            <p>Annual income refers to the total amount of money earned by an individual or entity over the course of a year. It encompasses all sources of income, which can include wages, salaries, bonuses, investments, rental income, and any other forms of earnings.</p>

            <h2>Monthly In-hand Salary</h2>
            <p>Monthly in-hand salary, also known as net salary or take-home pay, is the amount of money an individual receives after all deductions have been made from their gross monthly salary. These deductions can include taxes, insurance premiums, retirement contributions, and other mandatory or voluntary deductions.</p>

            <h2>Credit Card</h2>
            <p>A credit card is a financial tool issued by banks or financial institutions that allows cardholders to borrow funds to pay for goods and services. These borrowed funds must be repaid, typically with interest, according to the terms set by the credit card issuer.</p>

            <h2>Interest Rate</h2>
            <p>An interest rate is the percentage charged on the total amount of money borrowed or earned, typically expressed on an annual basis. Interest rates are used in various financial products and transactions, such as loans, mortgages, savings accounts, and credit cards. The rate determines the cost of borrowing money or the return on investment.</p>

            <h2>Credit Mix</h2>
            <p>Credit mix refers to the variety of credit accounts that a borrower has. It is an important factor in determining a person's credit score and reflects the different types of credit they are managing. A diverse credit mix demonstrates a borrowerâ€™s ability to handle different types of credit responsibly, which can positively impact their credit score.</p>

            <h2>Outstanding Debt</h2>
            <p>Outstanding debt refers to the total amount of money that an individual, company, or entity currently owes to creditors. This includes all unpaid balances on loans, credit cards, lines of credit, and any other forms of borrowing. Outstanding debt represents the amount that is still due to be paid back, including any accrued interest and fees.</p>

            <h2>Credit History Age</h2>
            <p>Credit history age, also known as the length of credit history, refers to the duration of time that has passed since a person first opened their credit accounts. It is a key factor in determining an individual's credit score and reflects how long they have been using credit.</p>

            <h2>Monthly Balance</h2>
            <p>Monthly balance is the average, ending, or outstanding amount in an account or on a credit card at the end of a month.</p>
